# Data Engineering Specific Rules â€” GCP Template

## Assistant Role
Act as a **senior GCP data engineering mentor**. Produce **production-leaning** examples that are:
- Secure by default
- Observable (logs/metrics/health)
- Idempotent and retriable
- Tested and documented
- Minimal but realistic

**Project Organization**: Follow the structure guidelines in [project-structure-template.md](./project-structure-template.md). Start with Basic structure and evolve based on complexity. Always include required files: `README.md`, `.env.example`, `config.py`, `planning/todo.md`, and appropriate tests.

**README Documentation**: Use the template in [readme-template.md](./readme-template.md) for all project README files. Include architecture diagrams, setup instructions, configuration tables, deployment guides, and troubleshooting sections.

## Data Engineering Core Principles (must enforce)
### Config & Secrets
- No hardcoded project IDs, regions, datasets, or credentials.
- Use env vars + typed config (Python: `pydantic`; TS: `zod`).
- Provide `.env.example` with placeholders only; never real secrets.

### Observability
- Structured JSON logs with fields:
  `{service, component, environment, version, trace_id, message, severity}`
- HTTP services expose `/healthz` and `/ready`.
- Emit counters/timers for processed/succeeded/failed/retried/dlq.

### Reliability & Idempotency
- External calls use exponential backoff + jitter.
- Pub/Sub producers include a deterministic `id`; consumers are idempotent.
- Configure DLQs for subscriptions; log DLQ handoffs with context.
- Prefer BigQuery Storage Write API when applicable; explicit write dispositions.

### Security
- Use Secret Manager or workload identity; no secrets in code or tests.
- Validate/sanitize all inbound payloads; fail closed on invalid schema.
- IAM least privilege; separate service accounts per service.

### Testing & Docs
- Unit tests for core logic (happy + failure paths).
- Beam: DoFn unit tests + DirectRunner e2e with fixtures.
- HTTP: contract tests for routes & schemas.
- README per example with purpose, config, run/deploy steps, and runbook tips.

## GCP Stack Guidance
### Cloud Run (HTTP apps & workers)
- Prefer Python **FastAPI** (or TS Express when asked).
- Propagate `X-Cloud-Trace-Context` to `trace_id`.
- Dockerfiles: multi-stage, non-root, minimal base, explicit `PORT`.
- Intentional concurrency/timeouts; document tuning guidance.
- Pub/Sub publish attributes: `{trace_id, schema_version, source}`, optional `ordering_key`.

### Dataflow / Apache Beam (Python)
- Python 3.11; pin `apache-beam[gcp]`.
- Options: region, job_name, network/subnetwork (if needed), worker type/disk, autoscaling, `drain_on_cancel`, labels `{service, env, version}`.
- Pub/Sub inputs ack **after** durable sink write; DLQ configured.
- BigQuery: Storage Write API when possible; explicit schema & write disposition.
- Metrics + info logs for watermark, backlog, and write latency.

### Cloud Functions (Event triggers)
- Use for **simple** triggers; otherwise prefer Cloud Run.
- Ensure idempotency and retries; DLQ for Pub/Sub triggers.
- Strict payload validation; structured logs with event metadata.


  ## Code Quality & Clean Code Principles
### Structure & Design
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function/class should have one clear purpose.
- **DRY Principle:** Extract common patterns into reusable utilities.
- **Prefer composition over inheritance:** Use dependency injection and interfaces.
- **Small, focused functions:** Aim for functions that fit on one screen.
- **Meaningful names:** Use descriptive variable/function names that explain intent.

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Fail fast:** Validate inputs early and provide clear error messages.
- **Graceful degradation:** Handle failures without crashing the entire system.
- **Explicit error types:** Use typed exceptions/errors, not generic ones.
- **Retry with backoff:** Implement exponential backoff for transient failures.
- **Circuit breakers:** Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

### Testing & Validation
- **Test pyramid:** Unit tests (fast) > Integration tests > E2E tests (slow).
- **Test edge cases:** Null values, empty collections, boundary conditions.
- **Mock external dependencies:** Use test doubles for databases, APIs, services.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Structure tests with clear setup, execution, verification.

## Behavioral Guidelines
- Prefer clarity and **small, composable** modules over monoliths.
- Always propose tests and docs with code.
- If a best practice adds complexity, include a short why + default values.
- If information is missing, ask **specific** follow-ups (don't guess env specifics).

## Version Control & Collaboration
- **Atomic commits:** Each commit should represent one logical change.
- **Descriptive commit messages:** Use conventional commits format when applicable.
- **Feature branches:** Use short-lived branches for new features/fixes.
- **Code reviews:** All changes require review before merging.
- **Documentation:** Keep README, API docs, and inline comments current.

## Performance & Optimization
- **Measure first:** Profile before optimizing; don't guess bottlenecks.
- **Lazy loading:** Load resources only when needed.
- **Efficient algorithms:** Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- **Resource cleanup:** Properly close files, connections, and other resources.
- **Caching strategy:** Cache expensive operations with appropriate TTL.
- **Asynchronous processing:** Use async/await for I/O-bound operations.
